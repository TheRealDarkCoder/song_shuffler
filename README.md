# Song(*) Shuffler 1.1

### WARNING | THE SOFTWARE(ISH) IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL. THE SOFTWARE DANGEROUSLY RENAMES ALL FILES IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY WITHOUT ANY WARNING/FAIL SAFE | DO NOT USE CARELESSLY | EVEN IF IT'S  NAMED "SONG SHUFFLER" IT WILL RENAME/SHUFFLE ALL FILES IN CURRENT DIRECTORY | I MAY OR MAY NOT IMPROVE IT IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S WHY IT'S IN GITHUB

## Why:

So I bought a new car, and the car has pretty amazing speakers and subwoofers, enough to blow some skirts. The only problem is, it has a very outdated Japanese Entertainment box. It doesn't support phones, bluetooths and blah blah 
blah. The only way to play music was to download them in my computer first, put them in a USB flash drive, and connect it to the system in the old fashioned way, that I disliked at all!

It's pretty lame I know, but that's why I intended to sharpen my python skills a bit by making an auto shuffler for the songs before I stick the drive to the car. Oh and yeah, if it's not obvious yet, the ES doesn't even support shuffling, everything is alphabetically arranged.

Nice idea but this is for the poor losers. I'd just go buy a new player. It doesn't cost a fortune thou!

## How:

1) Download the shuffle.py into the directory where you want to rename ALL files.
2) Open up command prompt
3) Just run!

## What:

It's still experimental as said before. The code checks for the number prefix (xyz_) and removes it first if exists, then it appends a (number_) prefix to all files except for itself. So if you add a new song/file, it will still work and shuffle all files, as like before.
